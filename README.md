## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into four main folders, each representing a different stage of the research process. Here's an overview of each folder:

### 1. **Data Extraction and Manipulation** (`DataExtractionAndManip`)

- This folder contains code for extracting Tweets using the Twitter API (with Academic Research privileges) and other data that was manually collected from various sources.
- Files in this folder include raw Tweet data (`.xlsx` or `.pkl` files), which are later used for data preparation and modeling.

### 2. **Data Preparation** (`DataPrep`)

- This folder includes the code used for cleaning and manipulating the extracted Tweets.
- The notebooks in this folder generate the processed datasets that are used in the subsequent stages of the research.

### 3. **Topic Modeling** (`TopicModeling`)

- Here you will find the code for performing topic modeling on the prepared dataset.
- Both Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Correlated Topic Model (CTM) approaches are explored in this folder, with comparisons between the two methods.

### 4. **Result Analysis** (`ResultsAnalysis`)

- This folder contains the analysis code used to test the study's hypotheses (H1a, H1b, and H2) and address the research question (RQ).
- The files in this folder will analyze and visualize the results, helping to interpret the findings related to predicting election outcomes from social media data.

## Guide to Using This Repository

- **Decompress Files**: Before running the Python notebooks, all compressed files (e.g., `.gz`, `.bz2`) must be decompressed.
- **File Dependencies**: Each folder contains `.xlsx` or `.pkl` files that are directly used by the notebooks within that folder. Files generated by one notebook and needed by another are located in the destination folder.
- **Comments for Clarity**: The code is well-commented to help you follow along with the decisions made throughout the analysis.
